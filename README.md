# simbo/vale-action

A GitHub action to run [Vale](https://vale.sh/) for spell-checking with optional
[Reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog) integration.

It does pretty much the same like the [official Vale action](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action),
but as this one is not using Docker, it's much faster.

## Usage

Use `simbo/vale-action@v1` in your GitHub action workflow.

Your project should have a [`vale.ini`](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/structure/).

### Example

```yml
jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: üõé Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: üßë‚Äçüè´ Spell-Check
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        uses: simbo/vale-action@v1
```

## Development

### Creating a new Version

Use `./release.sh <major|minor|patch>` which will create a git tag for the
respective version.

A release workflow will pick up the tag when pushed to GitHub, create a release
and move major, minor and latest tags accordingly.

To publish the release into the GitHub marketplace open
[releases](https://github.com/simbo/vale-action/releases) and
update the release for marketplace publishing.
